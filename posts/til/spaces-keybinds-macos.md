Getting used to a tiling window manager in Linux is dangerous, especially when switching between different linux and macos on a frequent. I have used both i3 and bspwm and their keybind to switch between screens (equivalent of spaces on macos) is a real productivity boost. And as I'm a vivid spaces user on macos this keybind is something I really need.

The default keybind on i3 and bspwm is `super + 1-9`, on macos I opted for `âŒ˜ + 1-5`.

Open up System Perferences. Go to Keyboard and then Shortcuts. Open Mission
Control in the sidepane and at the bottom in the right pane you'll see `Switch to Desktop <n>`.

If you don't see the number of Desktops you want you can open Mission Control and press the `+` to add the number of spaces you need.
